# RogueWaveInfiniteNLS.jl
Julia package for computing the rogue waves of infinite order for the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation.
This is a special solution of the focusing nonlinear equation denoted by $\Psi(X,T;\mathbf{G},\beta)$, which depends parametrically on a $2\times 2$ matrix and a scalar $\beta>0$. The matrix $\mathbf{G}$ is given by

The main routine is `psi`.
